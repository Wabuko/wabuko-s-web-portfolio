    <h1>MY WEB PORTFOLIO</h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Wabuko Aggrey and I'm very passionate about computers.</p>
    <p>My passion for programming came about after watching the movie Snowden.</p>
    <p>The movie opened my eyes to how much computers can impact people's lives.</p>
    <p>Given the current trajectory of technological developments,I saw it fit to give programming a try</p>
    <p>I joined Moringa School to help me develop my programming skills</p>

    <p>The lion has always been my favorite animal. It's strong and mighty. </p>
    <p>It strikes fear into any animal that comes along it's path</p>
    <p>I love it for it's boldness and might</p>
